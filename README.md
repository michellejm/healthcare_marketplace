Why this project and why now?
After many of my friends and coworkers were laid off or "exited", I have heard person after person lament how confusing the healthcare marketplace is. The most educated, successful, and type A people in my life could not understand the system or their choices. Any amount of clarity to this system will benefit it.

In this project, I'm exploring the Federal Health Insurance Marketplace. The goal is to shed light onto how health insurance works in a variety of states and situations. 

30 states are included in the federally run marketplace and 20 states use their own marketplaces. Of the states that use the federal marketplace, I wanted to know which states have the "best" (and worst) coverage options in terms of procedures covered, preventative medicine, copays, etc. 

Project Plan:
1. download the text from the plan brochures (web scraping, text wrangling) and align it with premium costs
2. simple search for a few keywords
3. summarize the plan text, with a focus on preventative medicine coverage and women's health (llm)

   User Project Plan:
1. Filter by basic demographics and then show summaries to make sense of coverage options
2. Ask users to explain their healthcare needs and match them with a plan (llm)
3. Calculators for what an expected year might cost (basic forumla)

Research Project Plan:
1. Which state has the highest median income vs. median premium?
2. Which state has the "best" preventative care and associated outcomes
